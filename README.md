## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate a claim of academic dishonesty within a district. It was suspected that the math and reading grades for the ninth grade class of Thomas Highschool were altered. In this notebook I went over the data for all the high schools in the district and turned all the ninth grade data from Thomas Highschool into a NaN values, as well as repeated the analysis to get a better idea of the overall affect it had on the district.
