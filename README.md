# PyCity_Schools

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate a claim of academic dishonesty within a district. It was suspected that the math and reading grades for the ninth grade class of Thomas Highschool were altered. In this notebook I went over the data for all the high schools in the district and turned all the ninth grade data from Thomas Highschool into a NaN values, as well as repeated the analysis to get a better idea of the overall affect it had on the district. 

## Project Results
While looking over the data and the reformatted data frames, I have come to a couple of conclusions,

* The first is that charter and district schools don't have many differences in performance, execpt for charter schools beating out district schools in math as seen below:

* Then if we start looking at the budget each school has available we can see huge differences. Charter schools seem to have a smaller budget compared to District schools, this can because of the amount of students in charter schools is significantly less than District schools. But if we look at the Budget Per Student, we see that Charter schools seem to spend less per student when compared to District schools:
